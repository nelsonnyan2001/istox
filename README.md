# iSTOX Frontend Developer Test

Please navigate into the folder with ` cd istox`

run ` npm i ` to install the dependencies.

You can either run 

` npm start ` or ` serve -s build ` 

for an optimized production build. The second command requires __serve__, which can be installed with 

`npm install -g serve` or ` yarn global add serve`
